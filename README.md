# Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch
This repository contains two machine learning projects I completed in June 2024 for a university project on supervised machine learning. The first project used decision tree learning to
evaluate cars based upon metrics and the second used a 3 layer neural network to classify clothing items using image data. I implemented
the algorithms for both projects from scratch and then evaluated their performance based upon tests I wrote. These projects were
highly influential in developing my interest in machine learning and data science. 

The directories for each model contain READMEs with much more information about the specific model and its performance.

I did not use GitHub for this project and am creating this repository as a platform to showcase the work.
