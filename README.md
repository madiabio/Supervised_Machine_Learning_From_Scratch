# Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch
This repository contains two machine learning models I implemented from scratch in June 2024 for a university project on supervised machine learning. The first project used decision tree learning to
evaluate cars based upon metrics and the second used a 3 layer neural network to classify clothing items using image data. I implemented
the algorithms for both projects from scratch and then evaluated their performance based upon tests I wrote. This assignment was
highly influential in developing my interest in machine learning and data science. 

The directories for each model contain READMEs with much more information about the specific model.

I did not use GitHub for this project and am creating this repository as a platform to showcase the work.
